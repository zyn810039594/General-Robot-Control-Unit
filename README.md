## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of the project is to build a robot system with high real-time and high reliability, and try to make it easy to use for developer. Now this work's just at a initial stage.

 ## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local FPGA for development and testing purposes. 

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. -->

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

<!-- Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
``` -->
